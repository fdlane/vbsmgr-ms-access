# vbsmgr-ms-access
MS Access application for managing large VBS events

This version of the VBS Manager solution is a MS Access application that consists of two database files. A User Interface database and Backend database where the data is stored.

The User Interface or Front End of the application is named `VbsMgr.mdb`. This is the file that users will open. All users can open the same database file or a copy can be saved on each users’ machine.

Your data is stored in a file named `VbsMgr_BE.mdb`. The `_BE` portion of the file name is used to indicate the ‘Backend’ of the application. This is where all your data is stored and SHOULD be routinely backed up.

## VBS Event Setup
- Open the application from `c:\fdlane\vbsmgr\VbsMgr.mdb`
- Enter data about your event
- Enter Children and Workers
- Print Reports
- Change the lives of as many Children as you can

### Pre-populated Tables

The following tables are populated with commonly used values and can be modified to meet your requirements:

- Ages
- Locations
- Neighborhood Types
- Worker Types
> Note: Do not delete Neighborhood types “Apartment” and “Subdivision”, these types are used to sort the roster reports for the bus routes. This makes for Happy Bus drivers!

### Classes

Enter all the classes for your VBS.  You can change the Age, Location, Master Teacher and Class workers at a later time

### Neighborhoods

Enter all of the neighborhoods that your VBS event will likely serve. Set the Neighborhood Type (Reports will sort Apartments alphabetically by Child name, and Subdivisions will sort numerically by house number). Makes for Happy Bus drivers!

You can add the neighborhood to a route later as you figure out bus capacity and a route’s current registration count.

### Children

You are now ready to start entering the children who are registered to your event.

### Buses

Enter your buses and their capacity

### Routes

Enter your routes,  assign a bus, and begin to assign neighborhoods.  This is where the fun begins…As you register children for each neighborhood, you will need to add/remove neighborhoods from a route or change the bus to a larger/smaller bus.

### Workers

You are now ready to start entering the workers who will be helping with the event.  Assign the workers to classes and buses.

### Reports

- Route Report
- Bus Roster
- Class Roster

### Attendance

Record attendance each day for children and workers.
